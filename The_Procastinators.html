								<h3>NAME: Jasmine</h3>
								<h3>STUDENT ID: s3945344</h3>
								<h3>STUDENT EMAIL: s3945344@student.rmit.edu.au</h3>
								<a class="image"><img src="images/Jasmine.PNG" alt="" width="300" height="300" data-position="center center"/></a>
								<p>I was born profoundly deaf, meaning I was born without the ability to hear (which was in both ears). However, I was lucky enough to receive surgery at a very young age, for cochlear implants - as a result, I wear hearing aids and have been for the majority of my life. My parents are from Singapore and Malaysia, but I was born in Australia. Therefore I am only fluent in English, however I did learn Japanese throughout the entirety of high school. I went to Westbourne Grammar School for primary school, before studying at Mount St. Joseph Girls’ College, where I completed high school. In my spare time, I enjoy playing a wide range of online games with my friends. I love playing first person shooter games, in particular, I am a big fan of the game 'Valorant'. My first proper encounter with IT was in Year 10, when I chose to study IT as one of my electives. In particular, I had always enjoyed learning the design aspect of IT, such as web development and the programming aspect as well. I always thought the idea of working on something and seeing the final result was very satisfying and I liked that feeling of accomplishment, hence why those aspects of IT always stood out to my liking. There was a particular person who sparked my interest, this person was my IT teacher throughout Year 10 to Year 12. She played a significant role in my interest in IT and she was also someone who believed in me when I had a moment of doubt about whether IT was the right career pathway for me. Through her, I learned how to use a wide range of software programs and because she made learning about IT fun, it allowed my passion for the subject to continue to grow. 
								</p>
								<h3><b><u>Tests:</u></b></h3>
								<i><b>16 personality test:</b></i> <b><u>Adventurer</u></b>
								<p>Based on these results, I am more of an introvert, observant, I follow my feelings more than my thinking, I am more prospecting rather than judging, and I am turbulent. Introverts have been known to gain energy from being alone and prefer to be in a more quiet environment to recharge. Observant (or Sensing) behaviour refers to gathering facts from relying on their senses such as sight, touch and hearing, they gather these facts from their immediate environment and surroundings. Lastly, I am considered a perceiver which is more focused on the organisational aspect in the environment. In my case, I am someone who prefers to be more flexible and not as organised in terms of keeping a tight schedule or list of things I have to do.
								</p>
								<i><b>Learner Style:</b></i> <b><u>Reflector</u></b>
								<p>People who prefer to observe a situation by standing back and watching rather than jumping into it belong to this learning style. They also prefer to look at things from many angles, gathering information from both first-hand and third-party sources. They would rather think about what is going on and take in what they are seeing in order to arrive at an acceptable judgement. Reflectors are also cautious, and they feel compelled to analyse all possible outcomes before committing to a course of action. Reflectors are said to learn best when they are given time to think before acting, as well as time to explore the circumstance. These learners like to work with the group rather than take the leadership role. </p>
								<i><b>Leadership test:</b></i> <b><u>Front-Line</u></b>
								<p>The front-line leaders are people who are hands-on and highly engaged with their team members, focusing heavily on knowing how to connect with them. It is also highlighted that front-line leaders aim to empower those around them, with the goal of helping them to achieve their best. These types of leaders are also known to display empathy and demonstrate authenticity for their team members. By being able to be authentic, they open and share themselves to others which can help with engaging team members to share the same vision the leader has.

								<h3>NAME: Appukutti Arachchige Dona Sudari Kawya</h3>
								<h3>STUDENT ID: s3943932</h3>
								<h3>STUDENT EMIAL: s3943932@student.rmit.edu.au</h3>
								<a class="image"><img src="images/Sudari.JPG" alt="" width="250" height="250" data-position="centre centre"/></a>
                                <p>I was born on November 12, 2003 in Colombo, Sri Lanka. I was born into a family of four. Who are my mum (who loves bossing the whole family around and security is the boss of all of us), My dad ( the only one who obeys my mum willingly), My older sister (the one one who thinks she’s the most intelligent one) and me (the one whos obsessed with food). My family made a massive decision to move to Australia due to the poor education and the security and some financial situations in Sri Lanka. I am personally a major music fan. As of now I have listened to more than 7 different languages worth of songs. I got into music because of my family background. My dad and sister used to sing in various different musical shows back in Sri Lanka. For me, The Internet provides individuals throughout the world with limitless opportunities. When the door to unlimited possibilities opens, people try to be creative in order to make their own imaginations come true, which may have either a beneficial or bad effect on the audience. It may be an unusual curiosity, but I find the negative component of this fascinating since it helps me to understand the negative aspects so that I may take steps to avoid them from occurring. This is why I'm considering pursuing a career as a cyber security engineer, since I want to safeguard Internet users from having a negative internet experience. Since I discovered this field, I've been learning about the dark web browser, which piqued my interest. This browser fascinates me because of the wide range of personalities that exist inside it. This web browser is not accessible to everyone, and it should not be. This is due to the browser's limitless capabilities and potential, as well as the fact that everything is done anonymously. Nobody knows who made what, who shared it, or even who is looking at it. That is the enthralling aspect of information technology.
								</p>
								<h3><b><u>Tests:</u></b></h3>
								<b><i>16 personality test:</i><u>Commander personality</u></b>
								<p>Group environments are almost a natural environment for persons with the Commander personality type. Commanders are praised for their efficiency and straightforward communication, their leadership is recognised, and their ability to simply get things done. However, certain situations are more suited for Commanders than others - these characteristics all lead to a management or executive position, making any position of relative weakness particularly unattractive.</p>
								<b><i>Leadership test:</i><u>Metamodern</u></b>
								<p>This leadership focuses on having a positive working environment which focuses on psychological safety. Metamodern leaders can gain engagement, inclusiveness and innovation from their group members as they communicate properly making a safe environment for the members to share each idea. </p>
								<b><i>Learner style:</i><u>Auditory/ Tactile learner</u></b>
								<p>This learning style focuses on hearing, listening and by physically doing the activity in order to learn.  Auditory learning methods make me remember things by listening to a lot of information such as either reading out loud when reading a book or listening to the teacher clearly when learning. Tactile learning style allows me to learn things by either physically doing it or touching. This learning style likes to explore and build things together in order to learn.

								<h3>NAME: Nafisa Rahman</h3>
								<h3>STUDENT ID: s3882020</h3>

								<p>I was born and brought up in Bangladesh and recently moved to Australia a few weeks ago. I completed my high school back in 2020 and then decided to study in Australia. Ever since I remember, we had a family tradition of travelling to a new place every 1-2 years which really grew my appreciation for various languages and different cultures. That’s where my love for picking up new languages came from as I always wanted to be a polyglot. I currently speak 4 languages (Bengali, Hindi, English, Japanese) and hope to add more to my list in the future. My South Asian heritage also meant we were always a household that was deeply appreciative of dance and various forms of music, which is why I naturally enjoy them as well. 
									The side of IT that I am most interested in would be User experience designing and Web development, as they are connected to one another. Whenever I am visiting a site or using an app, I immediately dismiss it and stop using it altogether if the design isn’t easy on the eye or if it isn’t comfortable to use. Regardless of how innovative or informative the app or website is, I am sure many people switch to different sites due to the same reasons as I do. It always made me wonder if I was the one in the driver’s seat, what touches I would put to negate this negative response from myself.
									 In my first year at Melbourne University, I did a subject that required us to design wireframes for a game and later create a prototype for it before moving to the actual programming part. I realised I enjoyed that more than any of my subjects I was doing at that time. I was initially doing computer science but after this I was set on doing IT as it was more relevant towards what I was interested in. But unfortunately, they did not offer a bachelor’s degree for information technology. I did not wait any further and decided to transfer to RMIT as they are known to have a great student experience for IT and computer science departments. Throughout my time here I hope to learn skills that would help me with my future job prospects and help me grow as a person.
									</p>
									<h3><b><u>	Tests:</u></b></h3>
									<b><i>16 personality test:</i><u>Campaigner</u></b>
									<p>Campaigners are known as the true free spirits. Because I am dedicated to developing my connections and social life, according to my MBTI, I feel it would be beneficial for me to build a friendly dynamic with individuals when working in a group situation. Some of my personality qualities indicate that I am insightful and a good communicator. These characteristics will help me communicate challenges and progress to others while I'm working with them. However, I am also disorganised and restless, which I have always been. When I'm attempting to meet deadlines, these things tend to bother me.
									</p>
									<b><i>Learner style:</i><u>Visual</u></b>
									<p>I am mostly a visual learner as shown by my result, vision being at 40% followed by auditory at 35% and tactile at 25%. I tend to learn by reading or seeing pictures. I also mostly understand and remember things by sight. Furthermore, I have difficulty with spoken directions, and I am easily distracted by sounds.
									</p>
									<b><i>Big Five Personality:</i><u>Extroversion, Emotional, Agreebleness, Conscientiousness, imagination</u></b>
									<p>Factor I is sometimes given other names, such as Surgency or Positive Emotionality. My Factor II is labelled as Emotional Stability. Along with that my Factor III is labelled as Agreeableness. A person that is high in agreeableness is said to be friendly and optimistic. My Factor IV is labelled as Conscientiousness followed by my Factor V which is Intellect/Imagination. This factor is also often called Openness to Experience.</p>

								<h3>NAME: Amulya Reddy Chitti</h3>
								<h3>STUDENT ID: s3884224</h3>
								<h3>STUDENT EMAIL: s3884224@student.rmit.edu.au</h3>
								<a class="images"><img src="images/Amulya.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="300" /></a>
								<p>I was born and brought up in India. Apart from English, I can speak Telugu and Hindi. I graduated high school from FIITJEE junior college in 2020. I love playing basketball and have participated in many competitions. I love to travel a lot. Recently, I travelled to Tasmania, and it was one of the best places I have ever been. Every day in Tasmania was memorable and exciting. I had the best hiking experience at Cradle mountain. I desire to travel more and more in the future and learn about different people and their cultures. During my leisure time, I watch movies in various languages; English, Telugu, Hindi, Malayalam, and Tamil. I even used to volunteer at Blue Cross, Hyderabad; it's an organisation for the welfare of animals. I took some time to decide what to study and did a lot of research. I finally decided to study Information Technology as it fascinated me. I believe it teaches many new things in this era of technology. I want to study Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning and how to apply Artificial Intelligence in different fields like healthcare, retail, sports activities, and security and surveillance.</p>
								<h3><b><u> Tests:</u></b></h3>
								<b><i>16 personality test:</i><u>Mediator</u></b>
								<p>Mediators have a vibrant, inventive, and imaginative character. They can create all sorts of stories and conversations in their mind and are curious and like to find answers. Being creative and innovative is one of the traits of a mediator. These personalities are ethical and kind and always bring positive energy to the room. Mediators try to understand people and their emotions. When someone shares their personal story, mediators will always be attentive and listen to them, and sometimes comfort them. Sometimes, they want to isolate themselves and be alone, and this will also help them find their inner self and cope with emotions and find their purpose.
								</p>
                                <b><i>Learner style:</i><u>Auditory</u></b>
								<p>Being an auditory listener means they understand and memorise information they have heard. They can soak up information they hear in a lecture or a presentation. Having an aural personality, I listen to my teammates and take observations and remember every detail. 
								</p>
								<b><i>Big Five Personality:</i><u>Agreeableness, Extraversion, Openness, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness  </u></b>
								<p>Based on the results, I'm open-minded to new and unique ideas and use my imagination to create an exciting world. It's easy for me to work in a team as I get along with others and bring positive energy. Though I'm neurotic, I try to give my best and provide substantial results. Being a neurotic also means I'm self-aware and take fewer risks. </p>

								<a class="images"><img src="images/Ethan.JPG" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></a>
								<p>I am a 20 year old Australian, I went to a Christian school all the way from prep to year 12. I only speak one language, it being English. I have travelled to the USA four times in my life. First trip was when I was only five and the last was when I was 17. This led to many people in my school believing I was in fact American, I’m not. Also I’ve been to all the mainland states, 48/50 in total.  My primary interest for studying IT is to one day be able to produce a product that others will like. My interest in IT began with video games when I was a child. Since I was two years old, I've been playing video games, the first of which was HALO. I've always wanted to be a part of something legendary, like the Halo series, since then. I took some IT electives in high school and built a mediocre bullet hell game, but it was a lot of fun. Now that I'm enrolled in a University IT programme, I can see that this is exactly what I want to accomplish with my life.
								</p>
								<h3><b><u>Tests:</u></b></h3>
								<b><i>16 personality test:</i><u>Campaigner</u></b>
								<p>which according to them I am a “true free spirit – outgoing, openhearted, and open-minded” person. I do resonate with this as I feel that I can work well with groups. I can make friends easily as I am a sociable person. The results show that I am a person who will make “longing for meaningful, emotional connections with other people . My personality allows me to mesh well with all kinds of people and let others take the lead and I can boost them.</p>
								<b><i>Learner style:</i><u>Visual learner</u></b>
								<p>This means that I learn more so by reading or looking at the content rather than hearing or doing it. I noticed this a lot during School as the way I would study is to write summaries and just read them over and over. I think it will influence my behaviour in a team in a limiting way. What I mean is that if I’m in a group of people that are all tactile learners I would struggle as they would want to do and learn the work in a way that doesn’t mesh well with me. Resulting in a smaller pool of people I can work efficiently with. I will take this into account by choosing my group carefully and being aware of the different learning styles.</p>
								<b><i>Creativity test:</i><u>Work in progress</u></b>
								<p>This category which for them is the middle point. I understand why I wasn’t put higher in the scale because if I’m being honest with myself, I would prefer to implement good ideas then come up with them. Not to say I’m not creative at all, as I do come up with things on my own etc. These results would influence my behaviour in a team by putting me down on the chain of command I feel, in the sense that the creative people hand out their ideas, or work, and I will be the one implementing them into our systems. This would mean I would have to take more creative people onboard in my groups to outweigh the balance of the group.</p>

								<h2><b><u>Group Process:</u></b></h2>
								<b>How well did your group work in assignment 2?</b>
								<p>The group members weren't as cohesive at the start of assignment 2 as everyone had hoped. It's most likely because we're all strangers to each other. However, we all came together nicely and effortlessly over the weeks of the assignment, including the meetings. Because the due date was so far away, most of the group members did not participate during the first week of the project. And the group had to deal with some glitches with a group member during the project. However, with everyone working together and openly discussing their concerns and challenges, we were able to complete the assignment on time. At first, the group split the work equally among themselves so that everyone could do their assigned portion. And everyone in the group has sought out to see if they need help with anything so that others have a chance to give them a hand if needed. 
								</p>
								<b>Will you be introducing any changes in process for assignment 3?
								</b>
								<p>From the last project, the group has learned a few things about each other as well as how each of the members contributes. As an outcome, we had to make a few changes before moving on to the next task. We only had one meeting during assignment 2 since everyone had enough time to complete their portion; unfortunately, since time is limited in assignment 3, the group has decided to meet twice a week to discuss any concerns, questions, or progress they are making on the work. One of the most significant changes is that we will have a group consultation with the lecturer during assignment 3 in order for the instructor to provide us with effective feedback for the work we have completed for assignment 3. The group website and github have also undergone adjustments. Only one group member had the chance to produce the CSS and HTML for the last assignment, which was completed during the last week of the assignment. Despite the fact that the website looked to be professional, all of the group members agreed to contribute to it this time.

									<h1>Ideal Job</h1>

									<h2><u>Jasmine</u></h2>
									<b><u>Ideal Job:</u>  Game Producer - UI/UX</b>
									<p>This position, which is provided by Riot Games, is focused on the vision of their product, a first person shooter game, ‘Valorant’. Riot Games expects the Game Producer II to be responsible for assisting in ensuring that Riot delivers content and features of high quality and satisfaction for their consumers. Other tasks the Game Producer II will have include being able to track progress with the gaming experience of their players kept in mind, focusing on organising priorities and goals, as well as delivering upcoming features and content. The Game Producer II is also required to work together with other positions in the company such as artists, engineers, and designers in order to present a quality product and experience for Riot’s players. 
									</p>
									<p>As a Riot Games consumer, particularly with their game, ‘Valorant’, I have always considered potentially working at Riot Games. What I find so appealing about this position is how heavily involved the Game Producer II is in the production of the game and the future developments that are yet to come. I find that it would be very rewarding to be working on the newest updates and seeing it in the game itself. Another aspect that I like about this position is the opportunity to work with artists and designers, which is something I have always wanted to do as I love seeing how a design can turn into something big such as a new character or a new map in the game.
									</p>
									<b>Skills needed:</b>
									<p>Skills a Game Producer II must have are the ability to collaborate and communicate with their team members, as it is crucial for them to work together to deliver content. It is also important that Game Producers have organisational skills, as their position is heavily focused on meeting deadlines and working on a time constraint. Game Producers would also need the skills to observe and have an extensive knowledge about the game industry, as well as being able to keep up to date with what consumers are having issues with or would like to see in the future. They are also expected to have familiarity with working with user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), and having an understanding of how it affects consumers, which also correlates with the skill of being able to understand what consumers want and how they can improve the product for a better experience. </p>
									<p>A Game Producer II must have qualifications and experience that show a deep understanding and knowledge of games. In particular, Game Producers require at least three years of experience as a game producer, product manager, or development manager, as well as experience with shipping games or game content in a production role, which means that they have managed to take a game or content to market. Riot Games has also expressed desirable qualifications and experience for their ideal candidate. The company desires someone who has had experience with a live game service, which means that the desired person is familiar with updating games and keeping to deadlines for new developments. Riot Games also desires a person who has experience working with distributed development and outsourcing. This includes working collaboratively towards the outcome of the product, which in this case would be the game ‘Valorant’. It also includes being able to work with third party teams to produce content for the game. The last desired qualification Riot Games seeks for is experience with “game content pipelines” which refers to the process of building a game from stage to stage, from the concept to the completion. 
									</p>

									<h2><u>Sudari</u></h2>
									<b><u>Ideal Job:</u>  Cybersecurity Engineer</b>
									<p>My basic plan in order to get to that pathway from where I am standing now is long.

The second step is to graduate and learn the basics components  of Information technology such as User centred design, networking, project management, software engineering and many other components. This provides me with a lot of knowledge that I may need when in the working field. After graduating bachelors of Information technology which takes up to 3 years, which is required to move on to the master of Cyber Security which takes about 2 years full time studying. Which majors in Discrete math, cryptography, coding for cyber communication, applied analysis, machine learning, networking, cloud networking, IT infrastructure and security. After completing these 2 years of masters I will be qualified academically to get into the job field in cybersecurity engineering. However, gaining industry experience is equally as important as gaining academic knowledge. Going into career expos from RMIT and gaining contacts from industry specialists can get me experience required for the final job. </p>
									<b>Skills required:</b>
									<p>Must have a graduate degree in one of the following : computer science, cybersecurity, information science or information technology. Should even consider having a masters and gaining experience and skills required.</p>

									<h2><u>Nafisa</u></h2>
									<b><u>Ideal Job:</u>Junior UX/UI Designer</b>
									<p>I would like to apply for the junior UI/UX designer position at the blue rocks. I have always wanted to work with UX designing as that’s what I have been most inclined to since a long time. I believe I can build on the skills slowly but surely to be a viable candidate for this position. Some of my responsibilities for this position includes joining the Product Team and helping with the product design-related efforts, including user research, prototyping, testing, and iterating on appealing and consistent UX for our products. 
									</p>

									<b>My current skills and skills needed:</b>
									<p>From the list I wrote above, the skills thatI currently have are for Figma but at a beginner level. I believe I must improve a lot and gather more experience using it for the above position. I am still not familiar with adobe illustrator or photoshop which I believe are integral skills required for any design jobs. I do have experience with working at group settings and I like to believe I have good communication skills, but they can always be improved. My design portfolio is still very much barren unfortunately, which I plan to work on throughout my time at university along with my other assessments. By the end of it, I hope to have a strong portfolio that shows my creativity and my keen eye for design.

									<b>Compare and contrast the career plans, including ideal jobs, for each person in the group. This may have changed due to the feedback from assignments 1 and 2. What common elements are there, if any? What differentiates each position from the others, if any? How similar or different are your career plans across the group?
									</b>
									<p>Looking at the group’s ideal jobs overall, it has been concluded that each group member has different ideas on what kind of job they would like to have after graduation. However, there are some similarities between some of the members’ jobs – for example, Ethan and Jasmine are both interested in pursuing a career in the game development industry, focusing on the production of the game. However, Ethan’s ideal job is more focused on the actual programming of games, while Jasmine’s is more focused on the development process as well as the process of shipping out games and working with updates. Jasmine’s ideal job also has some similarities with Nafisa’s as both jobs have been stated with interest in UX (user experience) and UI (user interface). However, as mentioned before, Jasmine’s desired job is in the game development industry, while Nafisa’s ideal job is more general, being in a particular UX team at her ideal company – Blue Rock.
									</p>
									<p>It can also be noted that everyone has a similar set of skills required in terms of general skills, which includes collaboration, communication, time management, organisation and problem solving. This can give an indication of how important those skills are and how they can contribute heavily in the work industry, regardless of how different the jobs may be. Although it is clear that the differences between the jobs outweigh the similarities, this can be from the job title to the responsibilities and skills that each group member will be expected to fulfil for their ideal job. As the jobs are different from each other, it is hard to find many similarities between them. At the same time, it also shows how diverse the group is with their interests and what they wish to see themselves doing in many years time.</p>
									<p>Even though all of the group members are kind of similar as the industry resembles Information technology. Sudari’s and amulays career paths differ from the rest of the group members. They both focus on the engineering side of things however ones focus more on machinery or hardware and one is more on the technical security side of things. </p>

							<h1>Project Description</h1>

							<h2>Overview</h2>

							<h4>Topic</h4>
							<p>Our group's overall goal is to develop an app that is inclusive of neurodiversity. Special features include "fidget toys," "pomodoro timers," "virtual study rooms," "to-do lists," and "white noise generators," among others. All of these activities are meant to assist people with conditions like ADHD or Autism focus more effectively in their daily lives. The ultimate purpose of this programme is for the user to improve their concentration and focus on what they are doing within a set amount of time. The "pomodoro timer" function allows the user to filter out all of the side distractions that come from other apps on the device.Implementing this functionality in the programme will improve the user's focus. The group has chosen to implement "fidget toys" to assist users with anxiety or to improve attention. Having a "fidget toy" integrated into a device can assist users in a variety of ways since they have it at their disposal anytime they want to feel anxious or out of focus. "White sounds" serve the same purpose as a fidget toy, but the primary distinction is that it enables the user to block out unwanted background noises when they need to concentrate on their task or relax. Different sorts of white noises, such as a whirring fan, radio static or television static, or even a hissing radiator, can be used to achieve this. The final feature that my group intends to implement within this application is "virtual study rooms." This feature will help users concentrate on their work more efficiently by allowing them to connect with other users who may be experiencing the same difficulties as them or simply share their knowledge. Some individuals simply focus better when they see others working. The user's environment might have an influence on their concentrating levels. 
							</p>
							<p>When creating prototypes, it is essential to consider how a user can get to where they are going in the fastest way possible. The use of pyramid navigation strategies, as well as clear entrance points, can assist users move across the programme more simply. Choosing an acceptable colour contrast is critical since colour influences a user's mood. Warm earth tones were used as the colour contrast for this application since they are thought to reduce anxiety and heart rate in people. Because they diminish respiratory rate and encourage calm and focused energy, these colours are also proven to help calm people with ADHD and Autism. The programme provides the structure of any basic application available to allow any user to effortlessly use the application. By using these colours and design ideas, the developer hopes to build a calming interface for every type of user, with a special attention on neurodivergent persons. When the user operates this programme, the developer's goal is for the user to get the most out of the application by focusing more strongly on the specific activity that they do. Alternatively, you may organise your workload by placing each activity on a to-do list and get a good use of every feature we implement on the application. 
							</p>

							<h4>Motivation</h4>
							<p>Our group member Nafisa proposed this project idea since she grew up with ADHD and wanted to build an application that would make her life and the lives of other neurodivergent people easier. Neurodivergent persons struggle with forgetfulness, disorganisation, being easily distracted, and having a poor sense of time. These elements can have an impact on one's academic performance, employment, and ordinary day-to-day living. This project idea is significant since this programme has unique features such as a virtual "fidget toy" option and other vital features that all help with concentration. Other features include a pomodoro timer that helps you filter out any distractions, such as notifications from selected applications, reminders, white noise, and virtual study rooms. Since this program focuses on virtual fidget toys and virtual study spaces. This application differentiates itself from the other applications that have already been built. To align with current IT trends such as cloud computing, cyber security, and big data, this application enhanced the efficiency and security of the big data collected from users. This concept would have a lot of commercial potential because it combines a lot of innovative aspects. These elements would be the most noticeable aspect of this application for employers. This programme is intended for Neurodivergent individuals, however users of all skill levels and ages are invited to use it. The design principles used in this application are user-friendly and simple to navigate for all types of users.

							</p>

							<h4>Landscape</h4>
							<p>Luna task is one of the most well-known concentration-focused applications ever produced. Lunatask is an encrypted to-do list, notebook, habit and mood tracker, pomodoro timer, and journaling software all in one. It recalls things for the user and keeps track of their mental wellness. This is a significant competitor since it offers highly specialised functionality that users seek, such as mood/habit trackers and journaling, all in one application. One downside of this programme is that it is not available in a mobile version and is only available for Windows or iOS devices such as laptops or PCs. There are some parallels and variations between the features of our programme and those of Lunatask. Fidget toys, white noise generators, and virtual study rooms are all examples of differences. The lunatask features, such as mood and habit tracker, journals, are also available. The features such as pomodoro timers, todo lists, and both are centred on concentration for the users are the only similarities between the two apps. Regardless of the fact that Lunatask is not specifically designed for neurodivergent individuals, it has been recommended by experts for users with disorders including Autism and ADHD to help with attention.
							</p>
							<p>The application tiimo is another major competitor in the market. This application is compatible with Android and iOS devices, including wearables. One of the most significant advantages of this programme above many others is that it can be used on a variety of devices. However, in order to obtain the full Tiimo experience, the user must pay a fee based on the plan that is best for them. However, because Tiimo has numerous partners in the development of the app, it is particularly intended for the neurodivergent community. Tiimo has visual timelines, production routines, pomodoro clocks, checklists, self-care suggestions, calendars, and reminders, among other things.Tiimo and our project are similar in that they are both especially developed to benefit the neurodivergent community, but they are both easy enough to use by any type of user. Both applications provide features such as pomodoro timers and checklists. However, features like routine trackers, self-care recommendations, and calendars are not available in our app.
							</p>

							<h2>Detailed Description</h2>

							<h4>Aim</h4>
							<p>Our overarching goal is to create an app to accommodate the needs of neurodivergent people.  Neurodiverse people suffer from certain developmental disorders that are normal variations in the brain, like ADHD or autism. Fidgeting, specifically in people with ADHD, is a symptom of hyperactivity. There are good fidgets that can help with increasing concentration. Fidget toys are now being made for people with ADHD, which include buttons, swivels and switches. Our goal is to create an app for phones or tablets that can act as a virtual “fidget toy”.  The app wouldn’t just include fidget activities but other important features all to help with concentration. The other features it would include consist of: Pomodoro timers, Reminders, White Noise and Virtual Study Rooms.
							</p>
							<p>As we don’t have the time frame to do the full app we have chosen to prototype a few of the features. We decided on working on Pomodoro timers, Virtual study rooms and White noise. The first step in achieving our main goal is to create the app prototype. We will do this by using (tool) to create a virtual app that can be tested. After we have the foundation for the app we will then work on the three features. Pomodoro timers are proven to be a useful study technique as it focuses the user for around 25 minutes, then gives them a 5-10 break time. This break time splits up the “mundane” work which allows for a good rest for people who struggle to stay focused. Another study technique is study rooms. Many people find that they work better when they are surrounded by others that are doing work as well. Virtualizing it allows for a portable study environment which increases accessibility for that technique as a lot of people can’t always be at those in person. Lastly, the white noise player. This player will consist of not only white noise but others like brown noise too. These noises when consistently played tend to drown out background noise resulting in a more focused mind.
							</p>
							<p>After we have created all the features of the prototype we will then survey neurodiverse people to receive feedback on the design of our app. After we have received all the feedback from the surveys we will then have a meeting to discuss the results. From the results we will then change our app, removing unnecessary features or adding elements that are missing. Obviously we don’t have time in our assignment to actually change the application but if this was a real project we would go about improving our product this way.</p>

							<h4>Plans and Progress</h4>
							<p>The beginning of our project started 6 weeks ago when we formed our group, “The Procrastinators”. The group consisted of five members, who presented their individual ideas for the project. In the end, the group found that it would be best if they were able to create an application, taking each member’s skills and experience into account. As a result, Nafisa’s idea for an application was chosen to be proceeded with in the next two stages of the project. Nafisa’s idea was a mobile application, being focused towards neurodivergent people and helping them with concentration, particularly when studying which is an environment that can be of a challenge to them caused by distractions. The group had liked how Nafisa wanted to raise awareness for people with ADHD, through the form of creating an application that they feel they can utilise often and for an application to act as an aid with their studying. 
							</p>
							<p>With this project idea set, the group had asked Nafisa to give an insight into her vision of the application. Nafisa has provided a range of different features for how the application can assist people with ADHD, including Pomodoro timers, virtual study rooms, a white noise player, reminders and a To-Do list. These features had been thoroughly researched by Nafisa and were compiled with the focus of helping neurodivergent people in mind. Nafisa also suggested how the application can be developed and what skills were needed in order to make this idea come to life. As she presented this idea, the group had shown a liking towards it and collaboratively as a team, had presented what they believed would make the application even more beneficial for their audience. The main idea that the group had liked that was not presented initially was suggested by Ethan, the idea of adding satisfying fidget activities – for example, a switch or a feature that would be linked to haptic feedback to help those with ADHD to destress and also help them to concentrate easier.
							</p>
							<p>As a neuro diverse person herself, Nafisa recognised the lack of application that she and others like her can use to help their conditions. Common symptoms of ADHD include: Forgetfulness, difficulties sitting still, carelessness and difficulties staying on one task. Our app aims to target these common symptoms. Pomodoro timers have been proven to help in staying concentrated one a task by allowing small rest breaks between work. We will allow the users to set reminders for their daily lives, they will be able to set how frequent they want notifications on their device. 
							</p>
							<p>The group then thought about how they were going to create a prototype to make this product feasible for their audience, which meant going through many wireframes which were sketched on paper and figuring out which designs were ideal for the users. Nafisa, being the person behind this idea, had taken initiative of how the application would look and how each page would come together to create this application. </p>

							<b>Process of creating the prototypes:</b>
							<p><b>Colour scheme:</b>For our project, colour choice was an integral part as they influence people's moods, make them think, and make them feel good. Upon some deep dive into colour theory and how it affects people on a psychological level, we found out that for both adults and children with ADHD, blues, greens, and subdued brown tones are excellent selections. We decided to go with green for our project upon mutual agreement. We chose a primary green colour that was used for backgrounds and most of the interface and few accent green shades to highlight our icons and features. This was to make sure our application maintained a specific theme and was cohesive throughout.

							<a class="images"><img src="images/prototype2.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100" /></a>
							<a class="images"><img src="images/prototype3.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100" /></a>
							<p><b>Design choices:</b>Aesthetic and minimalist design was also a key component for our interface design. We wanted our interface to be devoid of any clutter, and straight to the point. Every element that is present should be vital and provide useful information. There is no need to bombard our users with elements that are just there for fluff or are there just for vanity. As people with ADHD are known to have an attention deficit, it was integral for us to create an interface that had a smooth user flow and something that the user could pick up within the first use. Our users would otherwise be less likely to use, or even forfeit the entire application if it's difficult to learn. Here are some prototypes we created keeping this in mind.</p>
							<a class="images"><img src="images/prototype4.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="350" /></a>
							<a class="images"><img src="images/prototype5.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="350" /></a>
							<a class="images"><img src="images/prototype6.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="350" /></a>
							<p><b>Study room:</b>Clicking on the play button, beside the to-do list, would automatically navigate the user to a virtual study room where they can view who else is studying along with them in real time. The bottom tab below each study icon shows each users’ study time and their user ID’s. The ones highlighted in green means they are currently using the application and are studying along with the user, while the grey icons mean that they are currently on break or inactive. This ability to study with other users in real time and being able to see their data creates a sense of motivation for our user and also creates a sense of comradery. Furthermore, the user cannot exit the programme since the timer will stop if they do so. This is to ensure that our user can correctly track their working time.
							</p>
							<a class="images"><img src="images/prototype7.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="350" /></a>
							<p><b>Pomodoro timer:</b>By clicking on the pomodoro icon on the bottom navigation the user would be guided to a new page. They are then given a selection of different pomodoro timer settings they can choose from. The timer would run for the specified work time written and then provide the user with a ‘break’. There is also an option that allows the user to customise their own timer according to their preferred break and work time. Such a method of time- blocking and setting mini deadlines with this feature really helps maximise work efficiency for the user. 
							</p>
							<a class="images"><img src="images/prototype8.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="350" /></a>
							<a class="images"><img src="images/prototype9.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="350" /></a>
							<p><b>White/pink noise generator:</b>For the interface of our white/pink noise option, we decided to keep it rather straightforward and simple. Upon clicking the white noise option on the bottom navigation bar the user is guided to the next page. Here we have a variation of different white noise options that the user can choose from. The white noise will continue playing in the background as long as the user is in the app and only stops if the user hits the stop button or exits the application. White noise is the sound that surrounds us, such as that generated by heating and cooling systems, refrigerators, fans, or computers. Pink noise is similar to white noise but with lower frequencies. It appears to have a calming impact and increases work quality for individuals when it comes from rainfall, winds, or other natural noises. Currently we added 4 options to our playlist but we plan upon adding many more in the future.

							<p>By the end of this milestone, we would have completed prototyping for the features: pomodoro timers, virtual study rooms and the white noise player. Along with this, a survey that we would use to receive feedback for these prototypes from neurodiverse people. It is important for us to have feedback on our prototype to see how the user reacts and their experience with the product – looking further into what went well that the user found was great for the application, but also improving on what needs improvement because it is important that we are putting our users first when it comes to the experience of the usage of this application. 
							</p>
							<p>As a group we decided that if we were to continue this project till completion we planned for it to go roughly as follows; We would hand the surveys out and receive the feedback. We would meet and break the feedback down into what to add, what to edit and what to remove. Initially we wouldn’t act yet on the feedback. We would then prototype the other features being: haptic feedback fidgets and reminders. We would repeat the same survey with the same participants. After we have both results we would discuss the overall project. If it is mostly positive feedback we would continue the project. If not we would scrap it as a whole. If we continued the project we obviously would work on the feedback we received and continue this process until we are confident with the product. 
							</p>
							<p>Looking at issues and challenges that surfaced throughout the entirety of this project, the main issue was with the time constraint. Unlike a proper length project, this particular project only went for the duration of six weeks, making it not feasible to create a full fledged application by the end of milestone three. Therefore, there was a lot of consideration that was taken into place about how we want to approach this project, and also present a prototype that was true to the project idea. Therefore, after a significant amount of discussion and contemplation, it had been decided that the group was only going to aim to create three features with this prototype as three features felt like the most realistic approach to this milestone. However, if we were to consider handing over this project to a new team, we would have many more features and ideas to develop to become a tangible function of the application for users. 
							</p>
							<p>Another issue that arose was the unavailability of group members, however the reasons for the group members' unavailability were due to circumstances that could not be helped. It did make working on the project a bit of a struggle as many group members were unable to work on their respective parts by the set deadlines that had been discussed. However, the group ultimately agreed that there we needed to find out how to get the project completed but still to the best quality that we could present. Therefore, as a result, we had to ask for an extension for the project as the circumstances were making it very difficult for some group members to work on the project to the best of their abilities. With this extension, we were able to complete our proof-of-concept and also be more cautious about any aspects we may have missed out on during the previous milestone.
							</p>
							
							<p>Past this milestone like mentioned before, if we were to envision how this project will not only continue but also evolve, we would expand the horizons of the application through having more team members to work on the product but also have more innovative ideas to upgrade the product to make it highly desirable for neurodivergent people. This application and project idea will just become a long 
							</p>
							<p>This would not be a project that ends at some point, and rather it will continue on for many more years as it is a mobile application with the purpose of assisting neurodivergent people. Therefore, it would be predicted that the project will continue on for a long time and could possibly be very different to the initial project idea that we had come up with at this current moment. We believe if this project were to ever be passed on to another team of people, we would be able to have the resources, expertise and time for the dedication of the development of this application. With these aspects, we will be able to present a proper finalised product for users to use and hopefully, be able to find ways to continue to help neurodivergent people to be more comfortable when they are in times where they need to concentrate or when attempting to complete tasks such as studying or smaller goals like finishing a section of their school project, etc.
							</p>

							<h4>Roles</h4>
							<p> In order to work on the project in the most effective and efficient way, the group has decided to assign specific roles to each person. By doing so, it will help to work towards a common goal, which in this case, would be the project, by having everyone contributing to a different aspect of the application development. The group had discussed how having different roles would be beneficial towards the development of the project and it had been determined that the main benefit of this was that it was a similar concept to allocating specific tasks for each group member. 
							</p>
							<p>The concept is familiar but instead, the group was putting a particular title or position to each task this time. It was also determined that by establishing roles, it can also highlight what each group member is good at or which area they believe they are the strongest in. For example, there may be group members who are stronger in terms of design and the visually aesthetic aspect, and there may be group members who are better in the technical aspect of developing such as programming or working with a particular program or language to develop the application. So therefore, by having people work on what they felt like they would stand out in, it would contribute to creating a product that is of higher quality rather than having subpar aspects in the final product due to forcing someone to do a task they are not confident in.
							</p>
							<p>The roles that we had come across throughout the weeks were:
								<ul>
									<li>Lead Developer</li>
									<li>User Centred Designer</li>
									<li>Programmer</li>
									<li>Web developer/designer</li>
									<li>Editor</li>
									<li>Visual designer</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>In terms of specific roles – from the beginning, the group decided to have a “Lead Developer” role, who was chosen to be Nafisa. The Lead Developer is the person who will overlook the whole project and is the main person behind ideas and suggestions for the application. Nafisa was chosen as her project idea was chosen collectively by the whole group, and as the person who’s idea was chosen, it would be most appropriate if she had the most control over how the application will look and perform. The Lead Developer is responsible for presenting new ideas and also driving the direction of the project forward, allowing the group to have an understanding of what the final product should look like. 
							</p>
							<p>Other than this, Nafisa has also taken on the role of the User Centred Designer as well. Tying into how her project idea was chosen, Nafisa is also testing the prototype and seeking feedback from users in order to make this application more pleasant for the user’s experience. This links to her allocated sections for the report, which were concerned with the testing and the risks of this project, therefore she was willing to take on the role of the User Centred Designer.
							</p>
							
							<p>Sudari has been allocated the role of the “Visual Designer” as previously, she has presented the ability to see how to present information in a way that is visually appealing to the targeted audience. The visual designer is responsible for compiling ways to make the report and the application stand out, through the use of colours, shapes, images, etc. Sudari has the ability to be able to present content using a variety of colours that work cohesively together and also showing a clear idea of how the information should be laid out. </p>
							<p>The group decided to have a “Web Developer” which was Amulya as she had offered to be responsible for the HTML for the project. This was determined early on in the project as she had been the one to take on the responsibility of being the main developer of the HTML. The Web Developer is responsible for the creation of the HTML, making sure that it is functional and it presents the information of the project in the form of a website that users can access and use to discover more details.
							</p>
							<p>Ethan was also determined to be a "Technical Web Developer", however his role was more focused on ensuring that the HTML is functioning correctly. This was due to a few issues that came up with the HTML and Github previously in the last milestone, however were fixed by Ethan. Therefore, it was more than appropriate to make Ethan the technical web developer, where he focuses on the technicality of the HTML and ensuring that it is functional when used by others.
							</p>
							<p>Jasmine has taken on the role of Editor, being the person who makes final touches for any information and also working towards elaborating any certain points that have been made to provide more detail and understanding. The role of Editor is broad as it can be in reference to the report and fixing any points in a sentence that may cause confusion, as well as editing the actual design of the report – which may be in regards to how the information is being presented and the layout with how effectively it can deliver content for. 
							</p>

							<h4>Scopes and Limits</h4>
							<p>The project is the development of an application, “Trate”, which is used to assist people with ADHD or those who struggle to stay on task when it comes to completing work or studying. The group decided to work on this application in order to raise awareness for people who have ADHD, but also find ways to assist them with features that can be found in one place – making it both accessible and easier for them to use. This project is the final objective which the group will work together towards developing, however only to a certain extent where the group will be able to have a prototype which can be tested by users.
							</p>
							<p>In order to make this application into a tangible product for users, the group has considered and decided to use (tool) to develop this application. Each group member has been assigned a specific role, ranging from the design of the product to the development of the product to enable full efficiency, considering the limited amount of time there is to create this product. What the group aims to achieve by the deadline of this project is to present a product which can be interacted with by users and also serve the purpose that has been outlined for the product’s target audience, people with ADHD. </p>
							<p>This application has a range of features which have been compiled to make this application useful and needed. However, the group plans on offering particular features to present a concept of the application and give an idea of how the application can be used, as well as what it offers. The group has decided that there will be (number) of features that will be chosen to present as the application’s deliverables, which will be Pomodoro timers, the white noise player and the virtual study rooms. These features have been chosen as they would effectively show how the application would be beneficial for users out of the compiled features that have been presented previously.  
							</p>
							<p>What would be considered out of scope for this project would be adding the other features that have been compiled by the group. As mentioned before, due to the time constraints of this project, it would not be possible to present all the desired features of the application. The features that were not chosen to be included in this prototype are Pomodoro timers, the white noise player and the virtual study rooms.. The group has strictly chosen to do certain features, therefore adding additional features would be considered out of scope. 
							</p>
							<p>The limits of this project do vary from different factors and circumstances, however one of the biggest limits of this project idea is time. Considering this assignment is to be completed in the time period of four weeks, it can be deemed slightly impractical if the group wanted to make a proper application. Due to the time constraints for this project idea, there is only so much that the finished product/prototype can offer and it also does not give much room for additional features that would be highly desirable when aiming to make the application more appealing. 
							</p>
							<p>Another limit of this project is the tools and technologies chosen to create the application, considering that the group does not have the budget to purchase intricate software, hardware or programs to create the application. However, as this is a project for educational purposes, the group have been provided with access to exclusive features on particular websites, which the group will utilise when creating their product. It was also important to consider which tools to use as another limitation would be whether there are group members who know how to use the tool or have an understanding of it. Therefore, the group would need to take into consideration which tool to choose that every member is familiar with or can quickly pick up before developing the final product with the tool.
							</p>

							<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
							<p>To create the prototype for our application we first needed to design the framework for it. Initially we just used low fidelity wireframes on paper. Wireframes are a blueprint to help programmers and designers think and communicate about the structure of the application we are building. None of us have ever created wireframes prior to this project so it took a short time getting used to how to go about creating one. After the low fidelity wireframes were made we then transferred the design into figma to create a more high fidelity and functional prototype. Figma is a web-based graphics and prototyping application that allows people at all skill levels to easily create the user interfaces for websites, applications and even social media posts. We used it for designing and prototyping our application. We chose it as it has a very usable free program that allows us all the features we require. Once again prior to this project none of us had ever used figma. 
							</p>
							<p>If we were to continue this project past this current stage, meaning create a full fledged application, we would choose to use a hybrid model. The hybrid model would be utilising a few programming languages: Javascript, HTML and CSS. Hyper text markup language or HTML is the code for the foundation of the application, it will be the content we write to be displayed on screen. Cascading Style Sheet or CSS, will be the design of the application. Using our prototypes and wireframes we will recreate them with our CSS code. JavaScript on the other hand will handle all the technical aspects of our application. It will be the functionality part of the application. We as a group have a little bit of experience with all 3 of these languages as we are learning it throughout our course. Using them will increase our efficiency as we have learnt the basics of the languages and not learning a new one.
							</p>

							<h4>Testing</h4>
							<i>Beginning stage:</i>
							<p>To begin our testing process of our application we have first created low fidelity paper prototypes. This is to make sure we get early feedback from our users so we can cut down development costs in the long run. Lower fidelity prototypes tend to get more feedback from users as they perceive them as more fixable, so response rate is likely to be great. Building paper prototypes is fairly straightforward. We cut up pieces of paper and drew on them to make it resemble our interface. Including all the menu, windows, buttons etc. The user is going to interact with the interface using their hands, where pointing at something means clicking on it. We are also allowed to give the user verbal cues if we want to mention a specific transition or visual cue that would likely happen in the finished products of the application.
							</p>

							<i>Middle stage:</i>
							<p>After creating our low fidelity prototypes, we would move onto transferring our designs to digital and software prototyping. For our specific project we decided to operate using Figma as it allows us to create high fidelity mock-ups that can be tested on users with ease. This would also give us a better idea on the navigation and task flow of our product when users are actively using the application. Once all our prototypes are done, we move onto selecting our test users. When handling feedback from users, we must ensure the feedback that we are getting are constructive, sensible, and relevant. To ensure this, we are going to create a survey that would act as a screener for our test to get the right participants for our study. As our application is mostly targeted towards neurodivergent people, our survey will be designed keeping that in mind. In order to successfully complete our user testing we are going to need at least 10-15 users hence, our target is to send our survey to a minimum of 25 people.
							</p>

							<i>End stage:</i>
							<p>The most important part of user-feedback is so we can get insight on the difficulties our users are facing when interacting with our interface. We plan on making changes to our design according to this, which is usually an iterative process, and then moving onto the implementation process. Our main goal is to essentially compile all feedback and iterate through the design process as many times as it takes to come up with a final product that our users would appreciate using the most.

							<h4>Risks</h4>
							<b>Native vs Web vs Hybrid</b>
							<p>While developing our application there were a lot of questions, we had to ask ourselves as a team, the biggest question being if we want our application to be native, hybrid or a web application. Initially, as we looked back at our assignment 2, we took a more native approach when discussing how to develop the application and the tools and technologies we would need. Upon further research we realised it was not the best decision. If we look at some of the best applications found in the Apple store/play store, we see that most of them are native applications. Native applications are known to have the best user experience in terms of graphics, user reaction time and have some of the best app performance. We were hind sighted by these aspects and ignored the fact that they are really costly to develop and require a very steep maintenance cost. Furthermore, we require a different code basis for each platform we choose which is very time consuming. After evaluating all our choices, we decided to make our application hybrid. It seems the most practical to do with our resources and level of skills now. To build a hybrid application we would require knowing JavaScript, HTML and CSS and only one code base is required on all platforms (IOS, android). Additionally, we get to retain the same ability to access device features like native applications. However, Hybrid applications have a disadvantage when it comes to performance in terms of graphics, usability, and reaction time which we must keep in mind. We also realise that cross platform development is tough and getting our app to work seamlessly on each would require a lot of work.
							</p>

							<b>Functional elements</b>
							<p><b>Interface: </b>The design of hybrid applications is different from that of native apps. As a result, the user interface is less smooth. Possibilities are also limited owing to the usage of WebView, which prevents the full potential of the devices from being realised. In order to access a device's hardware features (microphone, camera, contacts, etc.) for which the native apps are installed, it is possible to include native elements of each platform’s user interfaces (iOS, Android): it is inevitable that native code will be used to access the specific features in order to create a seamless user experience. But this in turn becomes a hassle when it comes to the testing stage. Furthermore, there is a huge dependency on the browser's speed.
							</p>
							<p><b>Security concerns: </b>Many developers are concerned about hybrid mobile app security since these apps take more effort to safeguard. Because JavaScript and HTML are easier to reverse engineer and change, hybrid apps may be more vulnerable to cyberattacks than native binary code programmes. Through man-in-the-middle attacks, hackers can get access to a hybrid app's database and customer information.</p>

							<h4>Group processes and communications</h4>
							<p>Through previous experience, the group realised how important communication is and how it can make a difference when it comes to the progress and pacing of group work. Therefore, with this project, the group aims to contribute more to communicating with one another, whether it was through meetings on Microsoft Teams or messaging each other on other platforms. Previously, we realised that there were not enough meetings being held, which made it hard to determine how well the group was going accurately – measuring it on a “once a week” basis rather than more frequently. Therefore, in order to work on this issue, the group took initiative to meet frequently – through Microsoft Teams. Other than this, the group also met in person during tutorials to discuss progress and what would need to be completed, presenting priorities for the team. 
							</p>
							<p>Other than meetings, the group has strived to make use of messaging platforms to communicate with each other on a frequent basis. The most commonly used communication platforms were Discord and Messenger, where group members could ask questions in a quicker and more informal manner, which was what everyone was comfortable with. With this, it has been beneficial in organising meetings last minute and also just asking group members for insight, thoughts and opinions. When there were group members who didn’t respond to messages that were directed to them, we decided to give a time period (usually a day) to see if they would respond to the directed messages and if not, we would try to message them again. However, this has not been too big of an issue as group members were active in messaging and made sure to update each other.

                            <i>Why was this position chosen?</i>
							<p>This position was chosen as it would be highly desirable for the project, in order to create the application and to also contribute to updates when needed. If there is a group of programmers for the application, it will allow for a range of possibilities for how the project can be elaborated and worked towards helping neurodivergent people have an application they can feel that they can rely on. The application cannot be created without the assistance of programmers, who are the people who allow for this application to become a tangible product for users to interact with. Therefore, having mobile application programmers is considered a highly needed job for this project. 
							</p>

							<h3>Position 2:</h3><b>User Centred Designer</b>
							<p>To be able to see how the users interact with the application and work towards the continuous improvement of the application, making it more feasible and user friendly. As a User Centred Designer, the candidate should be able to work with a live application (meaning they are able to work towards the development of updates in live time, while the application is being used). The User Centred Designer should be able to keep up with trends in applications and have an idea of what features work best for users to provide a pleasant experience for users. The User Centred Designer should have knowledge of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).

									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Ability to set priorities and goals
									<ul>
										<li>This is important as the Designer should be able to see how they can improve the interface, focusing on the bigger issues first and working down a priority list.</li>
										<li>This also links to usability testing as the designer should prioritise what users find to be issues with the interface.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Time management
									<ul>
										<li>Should be able to stay on track and stick to desired timelines, as well as complete tasks when due.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>At least 1 year of experience in UX/UI design.</li>
							</ul>
							<i>Why was this position chosen?</i>
							<p>This position was chosen as the project idea is a mobile application, which means that there will always be room for improvement which would root from the user’s experience with the application. This means that in order to make the users have a more pleasant and convenient experience with the application, the application itself needs to be constantly worked on to ensure this for their users. </p>

							<h3>Position 3:</h3><b>Marketing Manager</b>
							<p>In order to reach out to users, a Marketing Creative would be needed to engage users and provide insight into what the application has to offer. It is important for the Marketing Manager to have a clear understanding of how to engage audiences and also know current trends, being heavily focused on the social media aspect of marketing. They should have experience with marketing, particularly with mobile applications such as “Name”. As a Marketing Manager, it is required that the candidate knows how to work with a team and lead them, but it is also expected that they know how to work independently. They are expected to have skills to build relationships as marketing focuses on engaging users and creating relationships with them.
							</p>
							<i>Responsibilities</i>
							<ul>
								<li>Analysing marketing data
									<ul>
										<li>Need to have an understanding of how to read data and find relationships between the data and trends.</li>
										<li>Need to be able to know how to effectively create marketing content to garner interest.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>

									<ul>
										<li>Need to know how users prefer to be marketed to (for example, noticing that TikTok marketing is popular currently, etc).
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Communication
									<ul>
										<li>As someone who will work in a team, it is ideal that the candidate knows how to communicate with their peers and use communication to achieve results.
										</li>
										<li>This is crucial as marketing managers are responsible for the development of relationships and understanding what users want.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Time-management
									<ul>
										<li>Should be able to stay on track and stick to desired timelines, as well as complete tasks when due.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>At least 3 years of experience in the marketing field.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<i>Why was this position chosen?</i>
							<p>This position was chosen with the vision of expanding target audiences through social media and the use of engaging with users, to build relationships with them. This is important because it can bring more people to the app just by providing a preview of what the app is and how it can be used, especially through simple methods such as simply uploading a post for the company’s social media.
							</p>

							<h3>Position 4:</h3><b>Penetration Tester</b>
							<p>A Penetration Tester is responsible for the security of the application, in particular, ensuring that hackers do not get access to users’ personal information. As the application requires users to have an account before using the application, there is a risk of hacking. The Penetration Tester is required to test the application’s security and report all potential risks and warnings that have been presented in the application. They should have experience with cybersecurity and programming, with problem solving skills in times of reverse action that may need to be taken.
							</p>
							<i>Skills desired</i>
							<ul>
								<li>Knowledge of programming languages
									<ul>
										<li>Python, Java, C++
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Problem solving skills
									<ul>
										<li>Should be able to know what to do in times of high concern in regards to the security of the application.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Knowledge of mobile interfaces.
									<ul>
										<li>iOS and Android</li>
										<li>Crucial as this application is for mobile and would be available on iOS and Android platforms, therefore they should have an understanding of how risks may look on each platform.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Able to set priorities and goals
									<ul>
										<li>Based on looking at all of the potential risks that the application may have, they should be able to set a clear priority list of what needs to be worked on urgently to what can be on hold for a moment, for example, small bugs.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Time-management
									<ul>
										<li>Should be able to set deadlines for when certain issues need to be solved.
										</li>
										<li>Should be able to set reasonable deadlines based on the urgency of the risk, for example, bigger risks should be solved as soon as possible.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>At least 2 year of working in cybersecurity or penetration testing.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<i>Why was this position chosen?</i>
							<p>As an application, it is expected that there may be security issues and risks that arise. Therefore, it is important to have someone or a team of people who will be able to prevent these risks and ensure that the application is not at risk of any sort of cyberattacks such as hacking. As users are expected to have an account, it is also the company’s responsibility to ensure that these users are safe and their personal info</p>

								<h1>Group Reflection</h1>	

								<b><u>Sudari</u></b>
								<p>Our group had to deal with a number of medical difficulties during assignment 3. Despite all of these difficulties, our group was able to complete the assignment efficiently. Throughout the assignment duration, communication was excellent. Due to personal reasons, some members of the group struggled to complete their designated section on time. Due to the fact that most of the group members were unwell from the second to the fourth week of the project, the group fell behind slightly in comparison to assignment two. Our group had already started the work late, making it far more difficult to complete it on time. One thing that surprised me was that, despite the fact that we were late and had to request an extension for the project by last week, everyone worked hard to complete it to the best of their abilities. Another aspect of this assignment that surprised me was the group's overall productivity. During this assignment, I noticed that splitting the group members into equal sections works best for our group since each member can focus on their section at a time and if another person has a problem with their section they would discuss it and seek help through the meetings which we hold each week .</p>
								<b><u>Jasmine</u></b>
								<p>Overall, the project was a great way to find people’s strengths when working in a team as everyone did what they felt like they were the strongest in. I noticed that we stood out in terms of communication as we didn’t rely on Microsoft Teams to communicate, and instead chose to communicate on other platforms that we were all more active with (Discord and Messenger). The biggest problem that had come from working on this project was due to circumstances that could not be controlled, which unfortunately did cause the flow of work to have hindrances and it did cause many group members to not be in the right conditions to complete their allocated sections as soon as possible. This was the only time where our communication failed slightly and caused concern with the progress as it had seemed like there was nothing that was being put onto the shared document. However, it also links to what I thought was surprising, which was that once everyone realised we were falling behind, we were able to make up for it and everyone was going at their own pace that was still enough for progress to be shown – everyone had worked really hard despite the circumstances.
								</p>
								<b><u>Amulya</u></b>
								<p>As this is our second assignment working together, we got to know each other a bit better. We discussed what tasks each member should work on and clarified that each team member contributes to different sections, and each one of us started working on our task. One of the biggest challenges we faced was time management, trying to complete tasks at a given particular time due to personal health problems. However, we managed to overcome this challenge and complete the tasks by communicating with other team members. We used platforms like discord to sort out the meeting and discuss our assignment process.Furthermore, I believe we should have assigned the dates for the meetings initially as some people are preoccupied with their other commitments. As most team members had health issues, we applied for an extension to ensure that we delivered excellent work. In the end, I'm delighted with the quality of work that our group produced, and I feel as a whole, we worked together in harmony despite a few challenges. 
								</p>
								<b><u>Nafisa</u></b>
								<p>This time around as it was our second time working as a group, we already had a good idea about what we are good at, so it was much easier and quicker to divide the tasks amongst ourselves without any difficulties. We were off to a good start for our project but it kind of fell through a little in the middle as some of us were dealing with health concerns. But overall in the end we managed to pull through. Communication this time around was much more consistent and smoother compared to our first time and we did not have any difficulties reaching out to each other. What we could have improved upon to ensure a better workflow was to schedule our meetings more strictly instead of being too flexible. But overall, I am really satisfied with the final product all of us put together. Everyone was responsible about their tasks open to feedback and asked for help if they thought it was too much for them to do alone. I am very impressed with how we worked together as a team overall.
								</p>
								<b><u>Ethan</u></b>
								<p>This group has been phenomenal to work with. Everyone was just on top of all their work at all points in time. As we had previously done an assignment together and this one is just an extension of the last we had our roles as a group all sorted. Meaning we knew what sections are best for people to do, like Amulya doing the website again and Nafisa nailing the prototypes. Many of us were going through medical issues while this assignment was taking place, covid, flu or new medications in my case. Even though we were struggling we all came together to help each other when needed. Our communication improved quite a lot from the last assignment. Overall we worked extremely well together as there was never any drama between us. If I had to pick one thing we could've done better, besides not getting sick, is plan meeting dates. There were many times where we just kinda threw one together and people couldn't make it due to prior engagements.</p>
								<b><u>Group</u></b>
								<p>As a group, we learned many things about ourselves and how we work in a group – highlighting our strengths and our teamwork to complete something as big as Assignment 3. The group had a rough start in the beginning as we only decided to begin working on the assignment about two weeks into the given four weeks, which had an effect on us as we were concerned that we only had two weeks left to work on the project. However, with this urgency, we were able to understand that we needed to get as much work done as soon as possible to be able to stay on time and set priorities of what needs to be done. It was important that everyone was working to the best of their abilities and staying on task, hence many group members had reached out to help each other when it seemed like we were falling behind schedule. In terms of specific roles for the group members, each group member did what they felt like they were the best at out of every task that this assignment had to offer. For example, Nafisa has shown that she is passionate about user interface and user experience, therefore wanted to be more involved in the development of the prototype. Similarly, Amulya felt like she was confident with working with HTML and had expressed the most interest out of all the group members. For Sudari, Ethan and Jasmine, they were more than happy to contribute more to the report to make up for the workload that both Nafisa and Amulya would have as developers of the prototype and the HTML. As shown in the table provided, each group member had taken on particular sections of the report in order to maximise efficiency, considering the time frame. Continuing, we realised how important communication is as there was a moment in the time frame where there was no communication occurring and it did cause some issues as no one really knew how the project is looking overall with progress in comparison to the deadlines that we had set for particular tasks. However, the group was able to bounce back and realise how communication can make a big difference, as well as also ease any concerns that may have been raised. We also took it as an opportunity to highlight what we lacked in the previous assignment and made sure to not make the same mistakes. Overall, the group was able to complete this assignment successfully and at ease as everyone was able to keep on task as we headed towards the deadline of the project.</p>
